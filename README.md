# Predicting Medical Charges_Linear Regression Model

Linear regression is a statistical method. This supervised technique is used for modeling and the main goal is to understand the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. This relationship can be used to make predictions or understand the impact of the independent variable(s) on the dependent variable.

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used techniques in statistics and in machine learning.

The profitability of a medical insurance company relies on revenue surpassing expenditures for the healthcare of its policyholders. The challenge arises from the unpredictability of medical costs, primarily driven by rare medical conditions.

The task is to analyze the company's historical data with the primary objective to develop a regression model for precise medical charge predictions and to evaluate its accuracy.

Furthermore, identify the key factors influencing medical charges and present a comprehensive analysis of their impact.
